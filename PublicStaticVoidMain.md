# public static void main(String args[]) Explanation

JVM always looks for a specific signature of a method to start running an application/program, and that would be ```public static void main(String args[])```. Here args is an argument of type String array. Name of the argument(parameter) can be anything, not necessarily ```args```.

Also with the introduction of java args, instead of writing ```String args[], Stringâ€¦ args``` can be used. Keep learning to know more about each and every keyword.


```
public clas FirstJavaProgram {
    public stastic void main(String args[]) {
        
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!!!");
    }
}
```
In the above application example, we are using public static void main. Each word has a different meaning and purpose which is detailed below.


## public
## static
## void
## main
## String args[]/String... args
